---
--- `yaml-language-server` can be installed via `yarn`:
--- ```sh
--- yarn global add yaml-language-server
--- ```
---
--- To use a schema for validation, there are two options:
---
--- 1. Add a modeline to the file. A modeline is a comment of the form:
---
--- ```
--- # yaml-language-server: $schema=<urlToTheSchema|relativeFilePath|absoluteFilePath}>
--- ```
---
--- where the relative filepath is the path relative to the open yaml file, and the absolute filepath
--- is the filepath relative to the filesystem root ('/' on unix systems)
---
--- 2. Associated a schema url, relative , or absolute (to root of project, not to filesystem root) path to
--- the a glob pattern relative to the detected project root. Check `:checkhealth vim.lsp` to determine the resolved project
--- root.
---
--- ```lua
--- vim.lsp.config('yamlls', {
---   ...
---   settings = {
---     yaml = {
---       ... -- other settings. note this overrides the lspconfig defaults.
---       schemas = {
---         ["https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow.json"] = "/.github/workflows/*",
---         ["../path/relative/to/file.yml"] = "/.github/workflows/*",
---         ["/path/from/root/of/project"] = "/.github/workflows/*",
---       },
---     },
---   }
--- })
--- ```
---
--- Currently, kubernetes is special-cased in yammls, see the following upstream issues:
--- * [#211](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server/issues/211).
--- * [#307](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server/issues/307).
---
--- To override a schema to use a specific k8s schema version (for example, to use 1.18):
---
--- ```lua
--- vim.lsp.config('yamlls', {
---   ...
---   settings = {
---     yaml = {
---       ... -- other settings. note this overrides the lspconfig defaults.
---       schemas = {
---         ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/refs/heads/master/v1.32.1-standalone-strict/all.json"] = "/*.k8s.yaml",
---         ... -- other schemas
---       },
---     },
---   }
--- })
--- ```
