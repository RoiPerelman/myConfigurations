== Fonts ==

install from http://nerdfonts.com
My Recommended fonts
hack, FiraCode, Mononoki, Ubuntu, RobotoMono, JetBrainsMono, SourceCodePro

Best is to create a fonts folder inside myConfigurations and download to there

to make the fonts work, we need to link them
go to /usr/local/share and link
ln -snf ~/myConfigurations/fonts fonts

== Themes ==

first we need a gui application to apply the themes on the system

=== lxappearance ===
{{{bash
sudo apt-get install lxappearance
}}}

specific theme examples
{{{bash
# windows theme
sudo apt-get install arc-theme
# icons theme
sudo apt-get install papirus-icon-them 
}}}
