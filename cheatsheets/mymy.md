### Questions

- Difference bteween redux, zustand and react context. When would u use each?

- Your experience spans various roles, from Automation Software Engineer to

  one involving both edge and cloud components.
  How would u design a full CI/CD pipeline for a system like inspekto?

- Our system involves real-time video and lighting for quality inspection. Can
  you discuss any experience you have with processing real-time data streams,
  especially for computer vision tasks in an industrial or edge context?
  What would u use to process real time video streams?

- What do u think about the fact we don't use mendix

- When and where did u work with python? which python version?
  how do u compare python to other languages u know?

- What different libraries or frameworks did u work with in python?
